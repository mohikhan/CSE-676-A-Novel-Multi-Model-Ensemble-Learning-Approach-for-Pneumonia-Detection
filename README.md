# CSE-676-A-Novel-Multi-Model-Ensemble-Learning-Approach-for-Pneumonia-Detection

Steps for running the project:

Step 1: Download and unzip the dataset given at the link to your local machine: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia .

Step 2: Run the Resizer.ipynb in your local machine on the downloaded dataset by changing the directories path used already in the notebook to the current path of the dataset. We need to resize the images for one of our models used in the ensemble which is the RNN.

Step 3: Run Project-Final.ipynb in your local machine. If you get any error regarding any library not found, kindly install it in your local machine as we already installed in our local machine which you can see in the output of the notebook.

Note: For your convenience we saved the results of each step and cell in the notebook so you can see the results.
# Attention:
While running the code on your local machine, there will be several cells in the notebook that require you to change the path of the dataset used to your local machine path where you have downloaded the dataset. We have made a comment on the cells where you have to change the path explicitly to run. The comment is:

Attention TA: Please change the directory path according to your convenience wherever you will store the dataset.
The directory path here is the path where we have store the dataset in our local machine.
