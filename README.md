# CSE-676-A-Novel-Multi-Model-Ensemble-Learning-Approach-for-Pneumonia-Detection

Steps for running the project:

Step 1: Download the dataset given at the link to your local machine: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia  

Step 2: Run the Resizer.ipynb in your local machine on the downloaded dataset by changing the directories path used already in the notebook to the current path of the dataset. We need to resize the images for one of our models used in the ensemble which is the RNN.

Step 3: Run Project-Final.ipynb in your local machine. If you get any error regarding any library not found, kindly install it in your local machine as we already installed in our local machine which you can see in the output of the notebook.
